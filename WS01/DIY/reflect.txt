	In this workshop, I have coded my own string functions, instead of using the string library. Since c++ functions were not so different from C, I have taken it without a problem, however, I have done some mistakes while programming it, this is due to the lack of practice, probably. The first strings weren't that hard to code, but on the lasts strings I have got some struggling, mainly in the "strStr" this took me to look-up on the internet for further information, since I have never used this string before, I had difficulties understanding how this function works.

	Ultimately my personal thoughts about the existing functions affirm my view and decisions on the way they should be handled.
Still, if the final goal is simply to bring to the students a detailed understanding of how each one works, it will ultimately fulfill that role.

	These are just my thoughts, I don't have any intention to hurt or harm anyone with my point of view. I don't want to disband other person's point of view, indeed having different thoughts in the world of IT is good.
