In this workshop, I have learned about constructor and destructor, this workshop DIY was different from the past ones, it gave me hard time and brain work. 

Creating a constructor wasn't a big deal at all since I have followed the class lecture, yet there are still some little things that confuse me about constructor, nothing that can't be solved by studying. Destructor in my opinion is the most important one, it prevents memory leak, it deletes the memory, by using a destructor you can save a lot of time dealing with a memory leak. 

Usually using reference as an object isn't difficult for me, but I had difficulty on the std::ostream, the part that must get the length of the content took me hard, I had to admit that I lost almost 6 hours in this problem. Using strLen string function from DIY 1 directly was crashing the code, but I managed to fix it by putting after the if statement, before it I was trying to use sizeof, which is wrong, it doesn't work in this situation for pointers, I could understand it thanks to a video in youtube (Credits to Jacob Sorber, a source at the end of the file). 

Ultimately, I have dealt with constructors normally like any student, but the problem was something caused by the past learnings that weren't enough.
