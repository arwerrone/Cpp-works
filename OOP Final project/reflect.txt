	Final but not least, we reached the end of the milestone, the last milestone, milestone 5, in this milestone we put together the past milestones done, all the content we have been learning through this course, unfortunately, as a student, I dislike not getting the content, so I try my best to understand, is tough since is online, but everyone is doing their best so should I. This last milestone took me 33 to 45 hours to do, the task was long, tricky, but the main problem that took me a long time to fix a problem related to a previous milestone, something dealing with the read function, since I have implemented my own function there to avoid repetition and making the code more readable, there was a chance to be faulty, in milestone 4 submission it passed fine, but in milestone 5 I had to change it a little. After that, I encountered another problem related to the time, which took me six hours to find out that the problem was a simple math calculation mistake, I had to look into the first milestone time module to understand what it ask for. Although the milestones submissions may pass in the matrix, you still going to have to make some changes in the final. This was a nightmare.
Ultimately, I have learned a lot of things about object-oriented programming, and I hope I keep improving my skills with time.
Professor, it was a pleasure to have this class with you, keep your way of teaching, it is amazing.
